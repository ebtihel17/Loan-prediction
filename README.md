# Loan Approval Prediction 
- The Loan Approval Prediction App is a web application designed to predict the approval of loan applications based on user-provided information.
- Built using Streamlit, it leverages a pre-trained Random Forest model to assess various inputs such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and personal details. After processing the inputs, the app provides an instant prediction on whether the loan will be approved or rejected, along with the probability of the decision, making it a valuable tool for both applicants and financial institutions.
